\title{Custom plotting of drug-dose response}
\usage{
customPlotting(processedData, doseRespModel, .saveto)
}
\arguments{
\item{processedData}{an object of class 'processedData'.}

\item{doseRespModel}{an object of class 'drm'.}

\item{.saveto}{string; path to a folder location where the results are saved to.}
}
\description{
An complementary component of the modular library \pkg{screenwerk} providing a set of custom plots for the visualization of drug-dose responses.
\emph{\code{customPlotting}} is a function that generates a set of plots that provide an overview of the dose-response between drugs and samples.
Furthermore, it plots the dose-response matrix for drug combinations along with the dose-response curves for each individual drug pair.
}
\details{
The function \code{customPlotting} is used to provide an overview of the responses of all treatments between individual drugs and samples. This is of particularly benefit for large drug screens
in which a large number of drugs and samples have been screened.

Files are saved either to the specified location or the default working environment, with the corresponding folder structure: 'results/graphs/custom plots'
