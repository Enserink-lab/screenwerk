\title{Generate a list of rows, columns and wells for a given plate format}
\usage{
baseplate(plateType, zeroBase = FALSE, leadingZero = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{plateType}{\code{integer}; a predefined numeric value designating the plate type based on either 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 384 or 1536 wells.}

\item{zeroBase}{\code{logical}; if TRUE, then row and column numbering follow a zero-based numbering.
system. The default is FALSE, in which the row and column numbering corresponds to the actual numbering on the plate.}

\item{leadingZero}{logical; if TRUE, then numeric column labels will have a leading zero based on a double digit format. The default is FALSE, in which column labeling corresponds to the actual numbering on the plate.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of S3 class "baseplate", with a list of \emph{rows}, \emph{columns} and \emph{wells}.
\preformatted{
 Attributes:
   $names
 [1] "no." "id."
}

Each list contains two objects: \emph{no.}, an object of type "numeric" containing the row, column and well \strong{numbers} and \emph{id.}, an object of type "character" containing the row, column and well \strong{labels}.

\description{
A complementary component of the modular library \pkg{screenwerk}, valuable for a wide range of analytical task in a drug sensitivity screen. 
\emph{\code{baseplate}} is a function that returns a list of rows, columns and wells associated with a given plate type. 
This tool is helpful for cross-referencing plates and plate layouts from different sources, i.e. different plate readers and other machines that use microplates. 
It proved to be essential in the process of consolidating data sets from different sources, i.e. dispensing files and raw measurement files with different row, column or well designations. 
\emph{baseplate} was designed with the objective in mind to address the incompatibility of different formats.
}
\details{
The value for \emph{plateType} is restricted to numbers that represent the number of wells for a given plate type. Any other number or value will lead to an error message and fail to generate a list.
The following plate types are supported: 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 384 and 1536

If \emph{zeroBase} is TRUE, the \strong{numbering} of rows, columns and wells will start with 0, otherwise if \emph{
zeroBase} is FALSE, the numbering starts with 1.

If \emph{leadingZero} is TRUE, the \strong{labeling} of columns and wells will have a 0 preceding single digit numbers, i.e. A01, instead of A1.
