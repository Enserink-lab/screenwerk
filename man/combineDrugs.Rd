\title{Combine drugs for a drug combination screen}
\usage{
combineDrugs(
  listofDoses,
  .combineDoses,
  .noReplicates = 1,
  .drugRepAttrib = c("all", "single")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{listofDoses}{\code{data frame}; a list of drugs and doses in long-format. The data frame needs to include a single column of drug names, doses and units.}

\item{.combineDoses}{\code{numeric vector}; an individual selection or a range of doses at which drugs are combined.}

\item{.noReplicates}{\code{numeric}; a value providing the number of replicates for selected drug combinations, representing technical replicates in a drug sensitivity screen.}

\item{.drugRepAttrib}{\code{character}; a predefined statement specifying, which drug treatments should be replicated. "all", both single drug treatments and drug combinations to be replicated,
"single", only single drug treatments to be replicated.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "data.frame", with an essential column of ['drug'] names, ['doses'] and ['units'] for each drug pair.
}
\description{
An complementary component of the modular library \pkg{screenwerk}, invaluable for the initial set-up of a drug sensitivity screen.
\emph{\code{combineDrugs}} is a function that combines drugs at selected doses, with each other. These drug combinations are used for the generation of a dispensing file, 
which is used to dispense drugs accordingly for a high-throughput drug combination screen. Drugs are combined either at all doses from a list or at defined ranges.
In addition, replicates can be generated either for all drug treatments, or for single drug treatments only.
}
\details{
This function is useful for combining drugs at given doses with each other. The combinations are generated from a list of drugs and doses, such as generated with \code{generateListofDoses()}. 
Drugs can be combined at individual doses, or at a certain dose range, in which a low index corresponds with a lower dose. i.e. a value of 1 selects for the first, and consequently, for the lowest dose among the list of doses. 
The range of 2:5 selects the second lowest up to the fifth dose. A negative number will selected all doses and excluded the dose at the provided index.
The default is to combine drugs at all doses with each other.

Each drug combination or drug treatment can be replicated into technical replicates. Depending on the selection, either all drug treatments are replicated or only single drug treatment.
If the replication number is not provided, then drugs will not be replicated and only one occurrence of each unique drug dose combination is retained.
If no group for replication is selected, all drug combinations will be replicated by default.

The function then generates a list of combinations containing a column with the name, the doses and its corresponding unit for each of the drug pairs. 
This list can then be used for the generation of a dispensing file with \code{generateDispensingData()}.
