}
\arguments{
\item{consolidatedData}{an object of class 'consolidatedData'.}

\item{.saveto}{string; path to a folder location where the object is saved to.}

\item{.ctrls}{\code{vector}; a list of controls to analyze.}

}
\value{
Returns an object of class S3:controlData. THe object will contain the data and plots generated with the analysis.

\description{
An essential component of the modular library \pkg{screenwerk}, and imperative for the quality assurance of a drug sensitivity screen.
\emph{\code{qc}} is a function that offers a set of quality control analysis tools assessing the variance of individual controls, reporting the z'-factor between the positive and negative controls,
as well as looking at the signal of empty and untreated wells.
}
\details{
The function \code{qc} is used to assess the quality of a drug sensitivity screen by looking at the variance and signal distribution between individual controls.

With the parameter \emph{.qcMethod}, it is possible to choose between individual quality assessments. At the moment the following quality control methods are available:

\strong{variance} : assessing the variance between individual controls both, across all plates, as well as by individual plate
\strong{emptywells} : assessing the signal of empty and untreated wells, this will also include any excluded wells
\strong{firstcolumn} : assessing the signal of wells in the first column of each plate
\strong{zprime} : assessing the z'-factor based on the distribution between the positive and negative control. 

Note: If \emph{zprime} is selected as a method, only two controls can be used for the assessment. The z'-factor is being calculated for each set of controls on each plate.
In any case where more than two controls are provided with \emph{.ctrls}, only the first two controls will be used as positive and negative controls. Please set the order of controls accordingly.
 
The z'-factor is a metric providing a measure of quality for high-throughput screens. The calculations are based on the z'-factor described in the
original paper by Zhang, 1999, J Biomol Screen (see references).
 
 
It is possible to run multiple QC methods at once, or all by simply specifying \strong{all} in \emph{.qcMethod}.

Any plots generated during the QC analysis will be saved to the location provided with \emph{.saveto}.
  
If a set of control plates need to be assessed, this can be achieved with the functions \code{\link{readRAWData}} and consequently plotting them with \code{\link{plot.readRAWData}}.

# Assessing the variance between individual controls

# Running all QC assessments
# Note: If zprime is being used, only the first two controls will be used as the positive and negative control. Set the order of controls in that case accordingly.
qc(consolidatedData, .saveto = "path/to/folder/", .ctrls = c("BzCl", "DMSO", "Untreated"), .qcMethod = "all")

# Assessing control plates
data <- readRAWData(.readfrom, .fileformat = c(".csv", ".txt"), .format = "EnVision")
plot(data, .saveto = "path/to/folder/")
