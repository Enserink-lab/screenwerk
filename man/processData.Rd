}
\arguments{
\item{consolidatedData}{an object of class 'consolidatedData'.}

\item{.ctrls}{\code{list}; a list containing the name of the positive and negative control.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class S3:processedData
}
\description{
An essential component of the modular library \pkg{screenwerk}, and imperative for the downstream analysis of the experimental data from a drug sensitivity screen.
\emph{\code{processData}} is a function that normalizes the raw measurements to the positive and negative control, and subsequently splits the data into individual data sets, 
one for the controls, single drug treatments and combination treatments, in case of a drug combination screen. Furthermore, a data table and a matrix is assembled for each drug pair, 
representing the dose response between two drugs at each dose.
}
\details{
The function \code{processData} is used to prepare the data for various tasks in the downstream analysis of the drug sensitivity screen. It carries out three essential steps in data processing: 
normalizing, splitting and assembling (re-formatting) the data.

\emph{.ctrls} is essential for the normalization of the raw measurements to the psoitive and negative control.
