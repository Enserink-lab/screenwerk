\title{Saving a set of dispensing files}
\usage{
\method{save}{dispensingData}(x, .saveto, ..., .sets, .labels, .split = FALSE, .format)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class 'dispensingData'.}

\item{.saveto}{\code{character}; a path to a folder location where the object is saved to.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\item{.sets}{\code{numeric}; a value determining the number of sets to create, or logical; if TRUE, the number of sets will depend on the labels provided.}

\item{.labels}{\code{vector}; a set of labels to be used for each individual set.}

\item{.split}{\code{logical}; if TRUE, the function will split each set into individual files. The default is FALSE, in which a single file is created.}

\item{.format}{\code{character}; a predefined identifier, which will decide  the format and layout of the dispensing file (see Details, for more information).}
}
\description{
The function \emph{\code{save}} creates a set of dispensing files, which can be used to provide instructions to dispensing robots on how to dispense a set of drugs, controls and samples.
Those files serve as a blueprint for printing a set of \emph{destination plates} from a set of \emph{source plates} based on the dispensing layout provided.
}
\details{
This function extends the generic function \code{\link{save}} for objects of class 'dispensingData'. It exports a set of dispensing files for a given number of sets. The possibility to generate multiple identical sets from a single dispensing layout, is required, whenever a drug screen is being performed on multiple samples, e.g. cell lines.
In certain instances, an experiment requires to be repeated, either to obtain experimental replicates, or due to a failed experiment. In either case, a single dispensing layout can be replicated based to an unlimited number of sets as needed. 

The labels can be assigned to each dispensing set either through a predefined selection of labels by using either a set of alphabetic or numeric values. 
This can be accomplished by setting \code{.format} = "alphabetic", or \code{.format} = "numeric", respectively. Otherwise, the labels have to be explicitly stated for each individual set.

Please note, that if the number of sets is not provided, or explicitly set as \code{FALSE}, any provided labels will be ignored. If the argument is set as TRUE, instead of a numeric value, the number of sets will depend on the number of labels provided. 
In that case, for each label a set will be created. If the number of sets is large than the number of labels provided, the function will result in an error, while if the number of sets is smaller than the number of labels provided, only the first \emph{n} labels will be used.
 
Also in cases, where only one set is being requested, the \code{.split} argument will be ignored, since the dispensing file cannot be split with a single data set.


Furthermore, depending on how the dispensing files are read and used for dispensing, each set can be saved as an individual file, or as a single file containing all the individual replicates.

The format of the dispensing file, is device specific and depends on the machine that is being used to carry out the dispensing. As of now, the following machines are supported:

\tabular{rlrl}{
\verb{  } \tab Type:             \tab \verb{ } \tab Echo Acoustic Liquid Handlers \cr
\verb{  } \tab Manufacturer:     \tab \verb{ } \tab Labcyte Inc., Beckman Coulter Life Sciences \cr
\verb{  } \tab Instrument Name:  \tab \verb{ } \tab E5XX-1366 \cr
\verb{  } \tab Instrument Model: \tab \verb{ } \tab Echo 550 \cr
}


To save the dispensing file in the format supported by the \emph{Echo Acoustic Liquid Handler}, set the argument using the instrument name or model \code{.format} = "E5XX-1366", or \code{.format} = "Echo 550".
If another model of the \emph{Echo Acoustic Liquid Handler} is used that supports the same dispensing file format, simply use the instrument group \code{.format} = "Echo".

Alternatively, the complete dispensing data can be saved, which allows machines not listed or currently supported in this package to pick individual instructions for dispensing. 
This is accomplished by setting the argument \code{.format} = "full" or \code{.format} = "complete".

The dispensing files will be save as a comma-separated values (csv) file, in compliance with the standard outlined in RFC 4180 (2005). For more information, see \url{https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt}
