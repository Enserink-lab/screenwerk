\usage{

\item{data}{an object of class 'processedData' or 'drm'.}

\item{.saveto}{string; path to a folder location where the results are saved to.}

\description{
An complementary component of the modular library \pkg{screenwerk} assessing the dynamic drug-activity range for individual drug-dose responses.
\emph{\code{dynamicRange}} is a function that estimates the dynamic drug-activity range (DDAR) across a number of doses for each drug response and generates a set of plots.
}
\details{
The function \code{dynamicRange} requires either one of the two data sets, either an object of class 'processedData' or an object of class 'drm'.

\code{dynamicRange} is used to provide an assessment of the drug activity range across the selected range of doses. It is an essential indicator, especially for
drug combination screens, in which only a selected range of doses are combined to assess synergies. If doses are combined at which drugs enfold their full inhibitory potential, it won't leave enough room for potential combinatory effects. 

The dynamic range is considered the dose-response range between the ED10 and ED90. This function will indicate the expected and the observed drug activity range for each drug and sample. 
It will generate plots based on the fitted dose-response models as well as unfitted curves.

Files are saved either to the specified location or the default working environment, with the corresponding folder structure: 'results/Dynamic Drug Activity Range' and 'results/graphs/dynamic range'
