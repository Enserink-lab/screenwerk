\title{Calculating synergies with bayesynergy}
\usage{
bayesynergy(processedData, .saveoutput, .plot, .saveto)
}
\arguments{
\item{processedData}{an object of class 'processedData'.}

\item{.saveoutput}{logical; if TRUE, then the output from code{bayesynergy} will be saved to file. The default is FALSE, in which the output is not saved.}

\item{.plot}{logical; if TRUE, then plots from code{bayesynergy} will be saved to file. The default is FALSE, in which no plots will be generated.}

\item{.saveto}{string; path to a folder location where the results are saved to.}
}
\value{
Returns an class S3 object of type list with the volumetric surfaces (VUS), the EC50s, summary statistics and additional quality parameters, along with a measure of synergy (bayesfactor).
}
\description{
An essential component of the modular library \pkg{screenwerk}, and imperative for the analysis of the experimental data from a drug combination screen.
\emph{\code{bayesynergy}} is a function that calculates synergies between two drugs in a drug combination screen based on a bayesian semi-parametric model.
}
\details{
The function \code{bayesynergy} is used to assess the interaction between two drugs across their dose ranges based on a bayesian semi-parametric model.
The analysis is based on the package \code{\link[bayesynergy]{bayesynergy}} as described in the original paper by Rønneberg, 2021, Brief Bioinform (see references).


Files are saved either to the specified location or the default working environment, with the corresponding folder structure: 'results/data/bayesynergy' and 'results/graphs/bayesynergy'
}
\examples{
\donttest{\dontrun{
# Run bayesnergy and save both the output and plots
bayesynergy(processedData, .saveoutput = TRUE, .plot = TRUE, .saveto = "path/to/folder/")

# Run bayesynergy without generating plots or saving the output
bayesynergy(processedData)
}}
