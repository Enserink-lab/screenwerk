\title{Exclude wells on 6-, 12-, 24-, 48-, 96-, 384-, and 1536-well microplates from an experimental setup}
\usage{
excludeWells(plateType, wells = NULL, outer.wells = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{plateType}{\code{integer}; a predefined numeric value designating the plate type based on either 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 384 or 1536 wells.}

\item{wells}{\code{vector}; a set of wells, row or column designations. Wells and rows need to be an object of type "character", while columns need to be "numeric".}

\item{outer.wells}{\code{logical}; if TRUE, the function will pre-select the outer wells for exclusion.}
}
\value{
A vector of wells on a given microplate to be excluded from an experimental setup.

Additionally, the plate layout for the given plate is plotted on screen, while highlighting all the excluded wells.
}
\description{
A complementary component of the modular library \pkg{screenwerk}, valuable for a wide range of analytical task in a drug sensitivity screen.
\emph{\code{excludeWells}} is a helpful function that returns a list of wells to be excluded from a 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 384 or 1536-well microplate in an experimental setup of a high-throughput single or drug combination sensitivity screen (DSS).
}
\details{
The value for \emph{plateType} is restricted to numbers that represent the number of wells for a given plate type. Any other number or value will lead to an error message and fail to generate a list.
The following plate types are supported: 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 384 and 1536

If \emph{wells} is provided, a combination of designated rows, columns and individual wells will be marked for exclusion. Both, rows and columns can be specified by their names, which are  designated letters for rows (A, B, C, ..) and designated numbers for columns (1, 2, 3, ..). Alternatively, in addition to entire rows and columns, individual wells (A1, B2, C3, ..) can be marked for exclusion.

If \emph{outer.wells} is TRUE, all outer wells of given plate type will be marked for exclusion. Note: allowing outer.wells to be TRUE for a 6-well plate will consequently mark all wells for exclusion on that plate!

Along with the \emph{plateType} at least one additional argument needs to be provided, either \emph{wells} and/or \emph{outer.wells}.
Designations that are not found for a given plate type will be ignored and produce a warning.

excludeWells(96, outer.wells = TRUE)
excludeWells(384, wells = c("A", "E", "M", 8, 12, "H3"))
excludeWells(1536, wells = c("AE", 12, "H3"), outer.wells = TRUE)
