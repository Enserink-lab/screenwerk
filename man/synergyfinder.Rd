\title{Calculating synergies with synergyfinder}
\usage{
synergyfinder(
  processedData,
  synergymodel = c("ZIP", "HSA", "Bliss", "Loewe"),
  .saveoutput,
  .plot,
  .saveto
)
}
\arguments{
\item{processedData}{an object of class 'processedData'.}

\item{synergymodel}{\code{character}; a predefined identifier, representing the synergy model.}

\item{.saveoutput}{\code{logical}; if TRUE, then the output from code{bayesynergy} will be saved to file. The default is FALSE, in which the output is not saved.}

\item{.plot}{\code{logical}; if TRUE, then plots from code{bayesynergy} will be saved to file. The default is FALSE, in which no plots will be generated.}

\item{.saveto}{\code{string}; path to a folder location where the results are saved to.}
}
\value{
Returns an class S3 object of type list with the synergy scores for each drug pair.
}
\description{
An essential component of the modular library \pkg{screenwerk}, and imperative for the analysis of the experimental data from a drug combination screen.
\emph{\code{synergyfinder}} is a function that calculates synergies between two drugs in a drug combination screen based on either one of the following models: Loewe, Bliss, HSA, or ZIP
}
\details{
The function \code{synergyfinder} is used to assess the interaction between two drugs across their dose ranges.
The analysis is based on the package \code{vignette("synergyfinder", package = "synergyfinder")} as described in the original paper by Zhenga, 2022, Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics (see references).


Files are saved either to the specified location or the default working environment, with the corresponding folder structure: 'results/data/synergyfinder' and 'results/graphs/synergyfinder'
}
\examples{
\donttest{\dontrun{
# Run bayesnergy and save both the output and plots
synergyfinder(processedData, synergymodel = "ZIP", .saveoutput = TRUE, .plot = TRUE, .saveto = "path/to/folder/")

# Run bayesynergy without generating plots or saving the output
synergyfinder(processedData, synergymodel = "ZIP")
}}
