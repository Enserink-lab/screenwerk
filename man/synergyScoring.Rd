\title{Scoring drug interactions}
\usage{
synergyScoring(bayesdata, .saveoutput, .plot, .saveto)
}
\arguments{
\item{bayesdata}{an object of class 'bayesdata'.}

\item{.saveoutput}{logical; if TRUE, then the data will be saved to file. The default is FALSE, in which the output is not saved.}

\item{.plot}{logical; if TRUE, then drug interactions scores will be plotted. The default is FALSE, in which no plots will be generated.}

\item{.saveto}{string; path to a folder location where the results are saved to.}
}
\value{
Returns an class S3 object of type list with ranked drug combinations and additional statistics.
}
\description{
An essential component of the modular library \pkg{screenwerk}, and imperative for the analysis of the experimental data from a drug sensitivity screen.
\emph{\code{synergyScoring}} is a function that scores drug interactions and ranks them based on their individual synergy scores.
}
\details{
The function \code{synergyScoring} is used to score and rank drug interactions between drugs of a combination treatment.
if plotting is set to TRUE, the function will generate three types of plots: (1) one in which all drug synergy and antagonism scores are plotted for each sample, (2) another one 
in which only the synergy score is plotted by drug fore each sample and (3) one in which only synergy and antagonism scores are plotted for each individual drug.

Files are saved either to the specified location or the default working environment, with the corresponding folder structure: 'results/synergyscores/bayesynergy' and 'results/graphs/synergyscores/bayesynergy'
}
\examples{
\donttest{\dontrun{
# Score drug interactions and save both the output and plots
synergyScoring(bayesdata, .saveoutput = TRUE, .plot = TRUE, .saveto = "path/to/folder/")

# Run synergy scoring without generating plots or saving the output
synergyScoring(bayesdata)
